# questions-and-answers-mabo2016
Just a simple website based on stack overflow

In development. Personal project.

TODO
(1) Add tags, to restrict questions and answers, and thus help users make less broad answers and questions.
(2) Fix the voting system. Currently a user can vote up or down more than once the same question or answer.
(3) Add a more elaborate profile page:
  (i) Users currently cannot add questions or answers to their lists of favorites.
  (ii) Users should be able to be able to browse their past questions, answers, and comments
 (4) Add notifications functionality:
  (i) Website should notify users of new answers to their questions, and new comments on their questions
  (ii) Website should notify users of comments on their answers
  (iii) Website should notify users of votes on their answers or questions
(5) Add the ability to create versions of the website, each one dedicated to a different discipline, like law, software, or 
science.

This is not ready for production.
